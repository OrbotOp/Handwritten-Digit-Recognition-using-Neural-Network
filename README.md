# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Introduction
This project is a Python-based handwritten digit recognition system that utilizes a custom implementation of a neural network. The goal is to accurately identify digits from 0 to 9 written by users. This system combines a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction with users, allowing them to draw digits to be recognized by the model.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3.6 or later is installed.
3. Install required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The main dependencies include `numpy`, `scipy`, `PIL`, and `tkinter`.

## Usage
To use the system, run `Main.py` through your terminal or command prompt. This will launch the GUI, where you can draw a digit using your mouse. Once you've drawn a digit, press the "Recognize" button to see the prediction.

## Features
- Interactive GUI for drawing digits.
- Custom neural network model for digit recognition.
- Utilizes the MNIST dataset for training and validation.
- Supports real-time digit prediction.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.6+
- numpy
- scipy
