# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview
This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset with a neural network, featuring a GUI for real-time digit recognition.

## Architecture
Utilizes a three-layer neural network: an input layer, a hidden layer with 100 activation units, and an output layer.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `requirements.txt`.
3. Download the MNIST dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/avnishnish/mnist-original/download).

## Running the Project
1. Run `Main.py` to start the recognition system.
2. Use the GUI to input handwritten digits for recognition.
